# Project 2: S&P 500 time series analysis
Using diffeComparing different time series model to find the best model that can predict the log return of SP 500. <br />
The best model has forecast MSE of 0.0144 and accurately predicts the log return of S&P in 2 year period within 2%.rent time series models to predict the future price of SP 500. <br />

The full report is in file [Time Series Analysis on S&P 500.docx](https://github.com/oceancode1997/SP500priceprediction/blob/master/Time%20series%20analysis%20on%20S&P%20500.docx?raw=true) <br />
